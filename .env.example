# Optional: Additional environment variables
HEADLESS=true
TIMEOUT=30000
# Navigation timeout (ms). Increase if login page loads slowly (remote server, VPN, heavy SPA).
# NAV_TIMEOUT=120000
# Tip: If Google Password Manager "Change your password" pop-up appears after login and blocks tests,
# the framework auto-dismisses it (clicks OK). To avoid it: use a test browser profile without
# saved passwords, or run in headless (Chrome often skips the pop-up in headless).
